    description: "The Infiniti Q50 was introduced as the successor to the G37 sedan, representing the first model under Infiniti's new Q/QX nomenclature system. Built on Nissan's FM platform, it debuted at the 2013 North American International Auto Show and went on sale in Q3 2013. Early models featured a 3.7L VQ37VHR V6 producing 328 HP (333 PS) and a 3.5L Hybrid combining the V6 with an electric motor for 364 PS total output. Both rear-wheel drive and Intelligent All-Wheel Drive configurations were available. The interior featured a dual-touchscreen infotainment system with the upper screen for navigation and lower screen for vehicle controls. Notable innovation was the Direct Adaptive Steering (steer-by-wire) system eliminating mechanical connection between steering wheel and front wheels during normal operation. European models also included a 2.2d diesel engine (OM651) producing 168 HP. Production began May 14, 2013 at Nissan's Tochigi plant."
