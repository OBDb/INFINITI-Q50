    description: "The Infiniti Q50 was introduced as the successor to the G37 sedan, representing the first model under Infiniti's new Q/QX nomenclature system. Built on an evolved version of Nissan's FM (Front Midship) platform, it features more fluid styling with a distinctive double-arch grille, crescent-cut C-pillar, and dynamic character lines. Initially powered by a carried-over 3.7L VQ37VHR V6 producing 328 HP, the engine lineup expanded to include a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder, a 3.0L twin-turbocharged V6 in multiple output levels (300 HP and 400 HP in Red Sport models), and a hybrid combining a 3.5L V6 with an electric motor. Transmission options standardized on a seven-speed automatic across all variants, with rear-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations available. The interior features a dual-touchscreen infotainment layout with the upper screen handling navigation and the lower screen controlling vehicle functions and settings. Notable innovations include the controversial Direct Adaptive Steering (steer-by-wire) system, which eliminates the mechanical connection between the steering wheel and front wheels in normal operation (with a mechanical backup), and the Dynamic Digital Suspension that electronically adjusts damping forces. A significant refresh in 2018 updated the exterior styling, interior materials, and technology features, while a more minor update in 2022 streamlined the trim structure and enhanced standard equipment. The Q50 represents Infiniti's core sports sedan offering, competing with established luxury sports sedans like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, and Audi A4, though it has maintained the same fundamental platform and design approach throughout its unusually long production run, now entering its second decade with only evolutionary changes."
